What would I have to remove to solve the subject/object problem?

All the clothes that we're wearing,
plus any jewelry

a glimpse down thetop of your
long-sleeve, unbuttoned,
button-up indigo shirt
and the purity
and the sick
and the sale
and the sick
and the warmth of your body

And I opted out
of ever asking your name.
The end.

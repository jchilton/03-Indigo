The Un-Zip Code
===============

11/30/2014

It's not a non-postal code
in that it's not a code
of conduct that emphasizes
healthy Byrneglish instead
of screaming at others
that they are "mentally ill"
when your highest education is
less than doctoral and not medical
anyway ("going postal")

It's not a sex joke,
in that it's nota code
of conduct that emphasizes
unzipping the pants and what that's a metonym for

No, it's a place that I walked through
and a time I was unknown
and the choice Imade only to pee there
then to move to traveled paths again.

What was it like, you ask, to be
out of the system? Unobserved, and
with absolute freedom?

It was challenging -- navigating by
my own internal compass, almost-not-fearing
but fearing ominous shapes in the wilderness and
dark and combating my own sense of vertigo.

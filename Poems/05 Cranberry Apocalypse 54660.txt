Cranberry Apocalypse 54660
==========================

And although the hospital staff in Tomah, WI
tried to discharge me without treating me, and
due to inadequate education called the police, I
managed to receive the treatment I deserved
which was a tablet of anti-nausea medicine
tiny, effective and indigo-hued not visually
but in my mind's eye this medicine created
the loveliest hue of indigo
And so I was saved from the yellow caffeine
and the poison green of your hair.
And here I was thinking I loved you
when really you were just working for me as
medical staff to get me the medicine that I needed.

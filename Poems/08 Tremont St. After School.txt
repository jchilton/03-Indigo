Tremont St. After School
========================

12/4/2014

Chinese girl absorbs
catcalls from black boys on bus
They make her stronger


Author's note:
These are the first 17 syllables in my head
after watching this scene unfold as I was going northeast on
Tremont and the girl and the school bus were going southwest.
I did not intend to write a haiku; it just came out that way.

Author's note to authors:
Always carry a pen. Always say "yes" when asked if you want a
receipt. Put the receipts in your wallet. That way you always
have paper.

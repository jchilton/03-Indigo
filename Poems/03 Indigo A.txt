Indigo A
========

11/27/2014

What would I have to do to solve the subject/object problem?

I'd have to un-glimp$e
down the
top of your long-sleeve,
unzipped zip-up

V-neck indigo sport
jacket sweater type
thing, and I'd have
to un-tell the
rough draft of this
poem to a person
who I think likes it rough anyway,
she's a
virulent strain of
the loveliest poison
and she loves making me
sick
